## CAse Converter

Program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case. <br><br>
The project has two phases: <br>
1. use a for loop to implement the program. <br>
2. use List Comprehension instead of a loop to achieve the same results. <br><br>

List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.
