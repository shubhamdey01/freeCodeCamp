## Building a Cipher

Learned fundamental programming concepts in Python. <br>
The first kind of cipher is called Caesar cipher. It takes each letter from the message, finds its position in the alphabet, 
takes the letter located after 3 positions, and replace the original letter with the new letter. <br> 
In Caeser Cipher, every single letter is always encrypted with the same letter, depending on the specified offset.
What if the offset were different for each letter? That would be much more difficult to decrypt. This algorithm is referred to as the 
Vigen√®re cipher, where the offset for each letter is determined by another text, called the key.
